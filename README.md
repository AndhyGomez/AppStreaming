This Emergency Streamer app contains a red button that will access the camera when clicked, the screen of your device will go completely dark as if it was locked. After the record button is clicked and the screen of your phone is dark, it will start recording and using your twitch stream key to access your channel and livestream

> This is a version of the [Emergency Streamer app](https://bit.ly/2JJKzNy) which has no login server authentication but can properly host a stream to a custom RTMP URL. The app is relatively unstable in this version


 
## Motivation
We live in a society wherein we might find ourselves in grave danger from one moment to the next. While leading our normal lives a regular day could take a turn for the worst, not only because of the many dangerous criminals that could hurt us, but also because of the people in positions of power that try to abuse us with no consequences.This app seeks to give people the ability to record secretly and safely while in a dangerous or abusive situation.
